                    <h3>1. Copyright and other intellectual property rights</h3>
                    <p>Copyright relates to literary and artistic
                        creations, such as books, music, paintings and sculptures, films and technology-based works (such as computer
                        programs and electronic databases). In
                        certain languages, copyright is referred to
                        as authors’ rights. Although international
                        law has brought about some convergence,
                        this distinction reflects an historic difference in the evolution of these rights that is
                        still reflected in many copyright systems.
                        The expression copyright refers to the act
                        of copying an original work which, in respect of literary and artistic creations, may
                        be done only by the author or with the author’s permission. The expression authors’
                        rights refers to the creator of an artistic
                        work, its author, thus underlining that, as
                        recognized in most laws, authors have
                        certain specific rights in their creations
                        that only they can exercise, which are
                        often referred to as moral rights, such
                        as the right to prevent distorted reproductions of the work. Other rights, such as the
                        right to make copies, can be exercised by
                        third parties with the author’s permission,
                        for example, by a publisher who obtains a
                        license to this effect from the author. 
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>cinematographic works to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;</li>

                        constitute intellectual creations” –
                        again, the Convention provides that
                        these “shall be protected as such,
                        without prejudice to the copyright in
                        each of the works forming part of such

                        without permission is the most basic right protected by copyright legislation. The right

                        performances of musical works – is the legal basis for many forms of exploitation of
                        protected works.
